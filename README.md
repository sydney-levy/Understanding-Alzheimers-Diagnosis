# Understanding Alzheimer's Diagnosis
## Harvard University Fall 2023
## Final Project for Introduction to Data Science (AC209A)

This project aims to understand how different factors affect whether a person develops dementia. 
Various ML models are utilized including decision trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and a multi-layer perception. 
The models predict the presence of dementia based on training parameters such as gender, socioeconomic status, age, number of years of education, MMSE score, eTIV, nWBV, and ASF.
